This file is for practising GitHub Commands 

ls -> show files except hidden files

ls -a -> this will show all files including hidden files 

After Modifying the file there is a 2 stage process : 
1. Add file 
2. Commit File 

To add the modified File :
1. git add <file_name>
2. git add .  -> this will add all modified files directly instead of adding one by one .
